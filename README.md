Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the starter files for Practical 6 in Computer Science 102.

## Introduction

This assignment requires a programmer to hack a Python program that scans for pixels in image files. See assignment for details. You are also required to write a mini reflection to answer three questions after you have created your program and had some time to experiment with it.


## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).
